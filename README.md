# ECOM — Electric Consumption Optimization and Monitoring

**Take Control of Your Energy. Join the energy revolution today.**

ECOM is a smart home energy management project designed to help users understand, optimize, and share their electricity consumption and production using IoT technologies and a web-based application.

## 🔋 Project Summary

Home electricity isn’t just about how much you produce — it's how much you **consume** that really matters.

Modern homes often waste energy through inefficient habits: heating, lighting, unused appliances, etc. Even with solar panels, mismanaged energy can nullify environmental and financial benefits.

**With ECOM, you can:**
- Monitor your home’s energy consumption in real-time
- Optimize device usage and reduce unnecessary consumption
- Share excess solar production with nearby homes (peer-to-peer)
- Save money and improve your ecological impact
